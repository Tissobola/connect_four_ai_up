    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- MCTS is well-suited for games with complex branching factors and imperfect information, making it a good candidate for Connect Four.\n",
    "- It uses random simulations to guide its search through the game tree, focusing computational effort on promising areas.\n",
    "- MCTS does not require heuristics for non-terminal game states, making it easier to implement and potentially more adaptable to different game states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "- MCTS typically requires a larger number of simulations to converge to strong move recommendations compared to Minimax. However, even with fewer simulations, it can still provide reasonable move recommendations.\n",
    "- The quality of MCTS recommendations can vary depending on the number of simulations performed, and it may not always find the optimal move within a limited number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Minimax offers a systematic approach to exploring the game tree but can be computationally expensive, especially in games with large branching factors. On the other hand, MCTS provides a more flexible and adaptable approach, particularly suitable for games with complex branching factors and imperfect information like Connect Four. The choice between them depends on factors such as computational resources, desired level of performance, and the specific characteristics of the game environment."
